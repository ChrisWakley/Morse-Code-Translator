# Morse-Code-Translator

In this project, my aim was to to create a functioning translator that took english as an input and translated it into morse code.

This project included testing which i found quite challenging to get right.

I'm happy with the project as it turned out, it works well and passed all the testing i laid out for it intially.

A future improvement I would make would be to add a reverse translate feature that took morse code as an input and returned english words as a response.
